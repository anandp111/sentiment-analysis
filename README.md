Sentiment Analysis App (Jupyter-based)
This project is a complete sentiment analysis pipeline built using Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebooks. It performs preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and live predictions on movie reviews using the IMDB dataset.

The application is modular, interpretable, and built according to internship project requirements.
